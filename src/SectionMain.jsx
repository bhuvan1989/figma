            onceptualized by a foodie Sister-Brother duo, while craving for
            Rajasthani flavors during their stint in Mumbai. Spice Platter was
            created to ensure authentic traditional flavours are made available
            at each table in the purest form, so nobody away from home has to
            trouble relatives for pure and authentic Masala! Honoring the rich
            cuisine, culture, and the ideology of their parents
